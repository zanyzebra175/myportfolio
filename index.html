        <p class="cardtext">
            Hey there fellow zebras! I am a computer science student at Brown University, primarily interested
            in creating and projects and applications for the purpose of understanding user behavior and psychology. More so than any front-end programming,
            I wish to demonstrate an interest in understanding user psychology and creating designs that are especially tailored towards said users. 
            On the side, I love to play basketball, perform music, and bask in the sun with my black and white stripes of course!

            <p class="cardtext">
                Below, you will find a carousel that will allow you to navigate through four projects from the course of this semester that allowed me
                to practice skills relavent to understanding user behavior, either through programming, design, or research. Each project within the carousel contains
                cards under to describe the context of the project as well as lessons learned from said project. I hope to demonstrate that I'm more than just a
                typical black and white (pun intended) user researcher, but instead that I put careful thought into tailoring the design experience to my users.

                Unfortunately, I am in many ways restricted from sharing my contact information directly. There's currently a law that says that zebras like myself must remain anonymous,
                but here's what you can do!

                The Samson Realty Project was a redesign of a realty company website in Providence, Rhode Island. The old website was outdated, riddled with ads, 
                and not responsive to different devices. This project gave me the opportunity to practice both simplistic design and programming skills, as I created
                a much more simplistic interface for the realty company that was responsive to multiple device sizes. You can read more about this project

                    This project gave me the opportunity to work heavily with wireframing, specifically through Figma. In redesigning the

                    had the opportunity to work with the Bootstrap library in my web development for this project, giving me experience with 
                    important web elements such as Nav Bars and more.

                    Given the scope of the project, there were elements of the redesigned website that were static/not made to be completely functional. If I had
